# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## To enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to: https://github.com/sh0umik/personal-website/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **Save**

The workflow will automatically:
- Build your Next.js site
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Make it available at: https://sh0umik.github.io/personal-website

## Current Status:

- ✅ Workflow file is configured correctly
- ✅ Build passes locally
- ✅ All dependencies are correct
- ⏳ Waiting for GitHub Pages to be enabled manually

Once enabled, future pushes will automatically deploy!
